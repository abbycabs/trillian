### Introduction

Trillian is an ambitious project that will require solving many complex organizational and logistical problems, but all are entirely tractable. People with very different skill levels will be able to contribute, wether they have a professional background in astronomy or not.

### Mailing List

The best way to express interest in contributing is to join the Trillian mailing list:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/trillianverse

Please feel free to post an introductory message to say hi! You can say why you are interested, what skills you can offer, and what piece youâ€™d like to work on.

### Understanding the Project

Currently, there are two places to get an introduction to Trillian. First, there is the main web site:

http://trillianverse.org

It has overviews for astronomers and for developers. The second is the paper written by Demitri Muna and Eric Huff, which can be found here:

http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5932

This paper goes into a great deal of detail about the aims and design of the project.

In the coming weeks, we will be writing a more detailed introduction for those who are interested in contributing to the project, geared for both astronomers and those with a technical background who are interested in astronomy. Reading as much of the material linked above will help.
